# havenspace

**havenspace** is an web-based interactive song, composed by Willow Bohlen in 2023. The original program notes are as follows:

I've always had an interest in exploring the format of 'performance'. My background is in electronic music, where performance doesn't really exist: the computer just produces a finished audio file. As such, I've always had the lingering question, “what can I do in a performance that I can't do with a recording?” I've come up with several answers, and Havenspace is one of them. It's fixed media but includes an interactive element that allows the audience to impact the listening experience in a way wholly unique to that performance. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure why I fixated on the name 'havenspace', but I feel that it represents a place between places, where moments converge in a fuzzy kaleidoscope of sound. This piece was originally presented with a big red button, which audience members could walk up and press. However, it works just as well with a keyboard or mouse.
